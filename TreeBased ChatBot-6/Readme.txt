This program uses a tree based structure to go through a set of prompts based on user feedback (effectively a chatbot). Users can
create their own set of responses that follows the same pattern as in "Example.txt"

To run the program:
- Compile all files
- Run the TreeDriver (and ensure that the Example.txt file is open in your repository)
- Type L and press Enter, then type "Example.txt" or your set of responses when prompted
- Type H to being traversing the tree
